# Introduction

This report presents a comprehensive data analytics project focused on e-commerce sales performance. It leverages statistical methods and visualizations to provide insights for strategic decision-making.

# Background

E-commerce businesses face challenges related to understanding customer behavior, pricing strategy, demand forecasting, and fulfillment efficiency. Analytics plays a key role in addressing these challenges.

## Ask

- What factors influence sales performance?
- How does fulfillment method affect revenue?
- What is the impact of product ratings and pricing on sales?

## Prepare

Data was collected from an e-commerce platform, including sales figures, product details, customer ratings, and fulfillment methods.

## Process

### **Data Preparation**

The raw data was examined and transformed into a structured format suitable for analysis.

### **Data Cleaning**

Missing values, outliers, and inconsistent entries were handled to ensure data quality.

## Analyse

We applied statistical techniques such as:
- Descriptive statistics
- Correlation and regression
- Time series trend analysis
- Price elasticity
- Control charts
- Hypothesis testing

### **Visualization 1: Z-Test for Sales Mean**
```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width='80%'}
knitr::include_graphics("visual_1.png")
```
**Insight:** The average sales amount is significantly lower than expected, indicating underperformance.
.

### **Visualization 2: X̄ (X-Bar) Control Chart for Mean Sales**
```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width='80%'}
knitr::include_graphics("visual_2.png")
```
**Insight:** Sales performance is stable and remains within acceptable control limits over time.
.

### **Visualization 3:Range Control Chart for Mean Sales**
```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width='80%'}
knitr::include_graphics("visual_3.png")
```
**Insight:** Quantity variation is under control, with most fluctuations staying well within control limits.
.

### **Visualization 4: Sales Trend Analysis**
```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width='80%'}
knitr::include_graphics("visual_4.png")
```
**Insight:**  Sales show a declining trend over time, indicating potential weakening in demand or seasonal effects.

### **Visualization 5:Correlation Matrix of Quantity, Amount, and Rating**
```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width='80%'}
knitr::include_graphics("visual_5.png")
```
**Insight:** Sales amount moderately correlates with quantity, while product ratings show no significant correlation with either..

### **Visualization 6: Actual vs Predicted Sales Amount (Multiple Linear Regression)**
```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width='80%'}
knitr::include_graphics("visual_6.png")
```
**Insight:** The regression model moderately predicts sales, but high variance suggests other factors also influence outcomes..

### **Visualization 7:  Sales Distribution by Revenue Category**
```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width='80%'}
knitr::include_graphics("visual_7.png")
```
**Insight:** Most sales fall in the low-value segment, indicating limited high-ticket transactions.

### **Visualization 8: Interaction Plot — Category vs Time Period**
```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width='80%'}
knitr::include_graphics("visual_8.png")
```
**Insight:** Sales trends vary by category, with "Saree" showing the most significant fluctuation over time.

### **Visualization 9:Price Elasticity of Demand Over Time**
```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width='80%'}
knitr::include_graphics("visual_9.png")
```
**Insight:**  Price elasticity fluctuates significantly over time, indicating inconsistent sensitivity of demand to price changes.

### **Visualization 10 Income Inequality Illustrated by Lorenz Curve**
```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width='80%'}
knitr::include_graphics("visual_10.png")
```
**Insight:**  The Lorenz Curve lies somewhat close to the Line of Equality, indicating moderate income inequality.

## Act

### **Conclusion**

The analysis reveals that product ratings, fulfillment method, and pricing play critical roles in e-commerce success. Seasonal trends and regional performance offer further insight into sales strategies.

### **Recommendations**

- Prioritize high-performing categories for promotions.
- Improve fulfillment processes to maximize customer satisfaction.
